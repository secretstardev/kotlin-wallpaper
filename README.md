# Olauncher
Olauncher is a minimal and ad-free launcher app for Android. It can also update your wallpaper daily, if you want.

## Installation

You can also clone the master branch and build the app yourself in Android Studio. No extra steps required. Or download the APK from [latest release](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher/releases/).

## What's new (v1.0+)

* Daily wallpaper update
* Improved app search, using regex
* Customize swipe left and right apps
* Tons of big and small changes based on community feedback to make Olauncher more user friendly

## What's next

- [ ] Hide apps
- [ ] Rename apps on the home screen
- [ ] Remove some low priority features from settings (suggestions are welcome)

It's getting too crowded in there. This is a "minimal" launcher afterall.

Olauncher recently got an [article in AndroidPolice](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/21/olauncher-gives-your-home-screen-an-open-source-minimalist-makeover/) and after that I recieved tons of messages to either fix something or add features. I'm working on them but it will take some time. Your understanding and patience is appreciated.
