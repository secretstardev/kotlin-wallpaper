# Olauncher
Olauncher is a minimalistic open source launcher app for Android.

## Installation

[Available at Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher)

You can also clone the master branch and build the app yourself in Android Studio. No extra steps required.

## What's next

Since this is a minimalistic launcher, I want to highlight its greatest feature which is called - no feature! Although the next version will have the option of daily wallpaper update.
