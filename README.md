You can also clone the master branch and build the app yourself in Android Studio. No extra steps required. Or download the APK from [latest release](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher/releases/).

## What's new (v1.0+)

* Daily wallpaper update
* Improved app search, using regex
* Customize swipe left and right apps
* Tons of big and small changes based on community feedback to make Olauncher more user friendly

## What's next

- [ ] Hide apps
- [ ] Rename apps on the home screen
- [ ] Remove some low priority features from settings (suggestions are welcome)

It's getting too crowded in there. This is a "minimal" launcher afterall.
