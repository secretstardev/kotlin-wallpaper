# Olauncher
Olauncher is a minimal, free and open source launcher app for Android.

## Installation

[Available at Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher)

You can also clone the master branch and build the app yourself in Android Studio. No extra steps required.

## What's next

Lots of feature requests are coming in but I don't want to clutter this app so I'm going to create Olauncher+ app (free and open source). It will be similar to this one but with much more cusomization options.
