Download from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.olauncher) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher). You can also clone the master branch and build the app yourself in Android Studio. No extra steps required. Or download the APK from [latest release](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher/releases/).

## What's new (v1.0+)

Biometric unlock getting disabled on double tap lock has been fixed, more or less. Max no. of home apps increased to 8. I hope that's enough for everyone. Wallpaper update frequency has been improved. You should see a new wallpaper every morning. No guarantees though. Improved text visibility. And a lot more.

## What's next

- [ ] Hide apps
- [ ] Rename apps on the home screen

## Known issues

* Android 10 gestures not supported
* Work apps not showing in app list

Your understanding and patience is appreciated.
