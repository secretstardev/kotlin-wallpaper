### Install from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/app.olauncher) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.olauncher) or download the APK from [latest release](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher/releases/).

You can also clone the `master` branch and build the app yourself in Android Studio. No extra steps required.

## Feature requests
Olauncher's user interface is insanely simple. Features are chosen very carefully because complexity grows quadratically since every feature potentially interferes with other features. We focus very narrowly on one thing and one thing only - a distraction free minimal launcher. We are not trying to optimize for some edge-cases. We are optimizing the user flow of the average users. Please don't be sad if we decline your feature request for the sake of simplicity.
